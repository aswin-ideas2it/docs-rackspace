UI panel format guidelines
==========================

Use consistent style and placement for text and icons in panels in the UI.

Use default values for page or window title bars, side navigation, fonts, and
text size. For example, tab titles must be a smaller text size than the
section heading.

Similarly, the node item title must be a smaller font than the page or window
title. If necessary, you might have to shorten the node item title in order to
maintain the default width.

The following image is intended only as a reference for the various UI
elements mentioned:

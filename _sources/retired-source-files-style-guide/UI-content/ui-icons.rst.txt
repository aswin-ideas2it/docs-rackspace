UI icon guidelines
==================

Be selective when deciding to use icons instead of text. It is often difficult
for users to understand the intent of an icon. New icons should be thoroughly
reviewed and tested by the user experience project. However, icons can
improve usability in specific instances.

Use an icon under the following circumstances:

- The icon is quickly recognizable.

  .. note::
     Consider global audiences and whether the icon is recognizable across
     cultural differences.

- The icon enhances design appeal.
- You have limited space.

For a list of icons and more about them, see the `Helix documentation <https://rackerlabs.github.io/helix-ui/components/icons/>`_.

If you decide to use an icon, follow these tips:

- Keep the design simple and consistent.
- Keep the location of individual icons consistent. Users recognize and expect
  patterns that help to establish meaning and function.
- Ensure the icon is quickly recognizable and memorable. For help, work with
  the UX design staff.
- If there is space, consider adding a text label to the icon.

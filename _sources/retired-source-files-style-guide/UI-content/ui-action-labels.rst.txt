.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1

     - Typical usage
   * - Create
     - Creates a new object.
   * - Delete
     - Destroys an existing object. The label can include the object being
       deleted, such as Delete Image.
   * - Download
     - Transfers a file to a user's local system.
   * - Edit

       criteria.

       object.

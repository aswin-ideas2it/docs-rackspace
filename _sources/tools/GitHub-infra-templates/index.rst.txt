GitHub templates
================

This section includes template files that can be added to your GitHub
documentation repositories to provide instructive information to users.

The template files are all coded in Markdown so that you can copy them and add
them to
any repository that you think might benefit from having them. Because they are
in Markdown, they don't show up in this published document like the rest of
the files, which are coded as rst files.

You can still move forward in this document to view the files by using the
**Next** button at the bottom of the page.
